      The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6:
      Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels
      will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For
      large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended
      for significantly faster uploads.
